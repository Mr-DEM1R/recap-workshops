Describe the difference between a commit and a push

In Git, a commit and a push are two different actions that serve distinct purposes.

A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to a repository at a specific point in time. When a developer makes changes to the codebase, they use the git commit command to create a new commit. The commit includes a message that describes the changes made and provides context for other developers who may be reviewing the code. Commits are local to the developer's machine until they are pushed to a remote repository.

A push, on the other hand, is an action that sends the local commits to a remote repository, typically on a code hosting platform like GitHub or GitLab. When a developer pushes their changes to a remote repository, they are effectively publishing their work and making it available to other developers on the project. Other developers can then pull the changes to their own local repositories, allowing for collaboration and integration of changes.

In summary, a commit is a local snapshot of changes made to a codebase, while a push sends those changes to a remote repository, making them available for others to use and collaborate on.
