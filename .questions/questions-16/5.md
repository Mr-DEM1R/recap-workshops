Imagine you're speaking to a trainee who is starting at Code Your Future for the first time. 
They ask the following question:

"What is the difference between github.com and Github desktop?"

How would you answer this question in order to help the new trainee?

 GitHub.com is a web-based platform for hosting and managing Git repositories, while GitHub Desktop is a desktop application that provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for working with Git repositories. Both tools are designed to make it easier for developers to collaborate and manage their code, but they serve different purposes in the software development workflow.
