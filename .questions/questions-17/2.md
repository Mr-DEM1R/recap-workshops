When using Github desktop, somebody sees the following error: 
"error: failed to push some refs to https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/HTML-CSS-Coursework-Week1"Â 

Try and think of 1 reason why you might be seeing this error
This error mainly occurs when you attempt to push your local changes to GitHub while the local repository (repo) has not yet been updated with any changes made in the remote repo.

So Git is trying to tell you to update the local repo with the current changes in the remote before pushing your own changes. This is necessary so that you don't override the changes made by others.

We'll be discussing two possible ways of fixing this error in the sections that follow.

Remember to commit and push when you're finished!
