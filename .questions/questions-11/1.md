Describe the purpose of a pull request.

A pull request is a feature of version control systems, such as Git, that enables a developer to propose changes to a codebase that are then reviewed and merged by other developers. The purpose of a pull request is to facilitate collaboration and maintain the quality of a codebase by allowing other developers to review the proposed changes, provide feedback, and make suggestions for improvement before the changes are merged into the main codebase.

When a developer creates a pull request, they are essentially requesting that the changes they have made be "pulled" into the main codebase. The pull request typically includes a description of the changes, as well as any relevant context, such as the purpose of the changes or any issues they are intended to address.

Once the pull request is created, other developers can review the proposed changes, leave comments, and suggest improvements. This review process helps ensure that the changes are high-quality, adhere to coding standards and best practices, and do not introduce new bugs or issues into the codebase.

Ultimately, the purpose of a pull request is to promote collaboration and maintain the quality of a codebase by providing a transparent and collaborative way for developers to propose and review changes.
